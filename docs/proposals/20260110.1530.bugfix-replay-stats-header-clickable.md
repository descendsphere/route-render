## 1. Summary

This document proposes the solution to a minor UI bug where the header of the "Replay Stats" panel is not fully clickable to toggle its visibility, unlike the "Route Stats" panel.

## 2. Problem

The "Route Stats" panel's header allows a user to click anywhere in the header area to collapse or expand the panel. The "Replay Stats" panel only responds to clicks on the "Replay Stats" text itself. This is an inconsistent and less user-friendly behavior.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1. Analysis

The root cause is an overly specific event listener attachment in `UIManager.js`. The click handler for the "Replay Stats" toggle is likely bound directly to the `<h4>` element within the header, rather than the parent `div` of the header itself.

### 3.2. Implementation

The fix is to modify the event listener registration in `UIManager.js`.

1.  **Identify:** Locate the code in `UIManager.js` that creates the Replay Stats panel and attaches the toggle event listener.
2.  **Modify:** Change the selector for the event listener from the specific text element to the container `div` that represents the entire header. This will mirror the implementation already in place for the "Route Stats" panel, ensuring consistency.

This is a low-risk, high-value fix that improves UI consistency and usability.
