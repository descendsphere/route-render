## 1. Summary

This document proposes a minor UI adjustment to create a visual space between the bottom UI elements and the edge of the screen.

## 2. Problem

Currently, the custom tour controls and the stats panels are positioned at `bottom: 0`, which causes them to sit directly on the bottom edge of the viewport. This can obscure the CesiumJS brand logo and text, which is undesirable.

## 3. Proposed Solution

### 3.1. Analysis

The relevant UI elements are `#custom-tour-controls` and `#bottom-panel-container`. Both are positioned absolutely.

### 3.2. Implementation

The solution is a simple CSS change in `style.css`.

1.  **Identify:** Locate the CSS rules for `#custom-tour-controls` and `#bottom-panel-container`.
2.  **Modify:** Change the `bottom` property for both selectors from its current value (likely `0`) to a small, positive value. A value of `20px` is recommended as a starting point.

This will lift both UI components off the bottom edge, creating a clear margin and ensuring all content is visible. This is a low-risk, purely cosmetic change.
