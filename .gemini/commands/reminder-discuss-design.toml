Halt the current implementation plan. I want to step back and discuss the design and architecture further before we write or modify any code.

Please prioritize the following in your response:
1.  **Alternative Approaches:** Propose and compare different architectural or implementation strategies for this feature/fix.
2.  **Trade-offs:** For each approach, analyze the pros and cons regarding scalability, maintainability, performance, and complexity.
3.  **Long-term Vision:** Explain how your recommended solution aligns with building a stable, enterprise-grade application.

Do not proceed with any file modifications until we have settled on a final design.
